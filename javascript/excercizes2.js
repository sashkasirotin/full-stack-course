/*Exercise 1
Basic Age Check. Create variables for a person's age and use an if statement to check if they're old enough to vote (18 or older). Display an appropriate message.

let age = 20;
// Your conditional code here

Exercise 2
Grade Classification. Create a variable for a test score (0-100) and use if-else if-else statements to assign and display a letter grade:

A: 90-100
B: 80-89
C: 70-79
D: 60-69
F: Below 60
let score = 85;
// Your conditional code here

Exercise 4
Multiple Condition Validator. Create variables for username length, password length, and user age. Use logical operators (&&, ||, !) to check if a user can create an account:

Username must be at least 5 characters
Password must be at least 8 characters
User must be 13 or older
Display specific error messages for each failed condition or success message if all pass
let usernameLength = 6;
let passwordLength = 7;
let userAge = 15;
// Your conditional code here

Exercise 5:
Complex Business Logic. Create variables for customer type (regular, premium, vip), purchase amount, and day of week. Calculate discount using nested conditionals and ternary operators:

VIP customers: 20% discount always
Premium customers: 15% on weekends, 10% on weekdays
Regular customers: 10% if purchase > $100, 5% if purchase > $50, 0% otherwise
Weekends are represented by day 6 (Saturday) or 0 (Sunday)
let customerType = "premium";
let purchaseAmount = 150;
let dayOfWeek = 6; // 0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, etc.
// Your conditional code here

Exercise 6
Leap Year Calculator. Create a variable for a year and determine if it's a leap year using conditional statements. A year is a leap year if:

It's divisible by 4 AND
If it's divisible by 100, then it must also be divisible by 400
let year = 2024;
// Your conditional code here
// Examples: 2024 = leap, 1900 = not leap, 2000 = leap, 2023 = not leap */

/*Exercise 3
Weather Decision Making. Create variables for temperature (in Celsius) and weather condition (sunny, rainy, cloudy). Use nested conditionals to decide what activity to recommend:

If sunny and temp > 24°C: "Go to the beach"
If sunny and temp 15-24°C: "Go for a walk"
If sunny and temp < 15°C: "Stay inside and read"
If rainy: "Watch a movie indoors"
If cloudy and temp > 21°C: "Go hiking"
If cloudy and temp <= 21°C: "Visit a museum"
